The repository root is not the primary runnable app surface.
Runnable application roots live under `apps/<application-root>/`.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sdkwork-image-flutter-mobile | flutter-mobile | yes | sdkwork-image-flutter-mobile flutter-mobile application root. | `sdkwork-image-flutter-mobile/` |
| sdkwork-image-h5 | h5 | yes | sdkwork-image-h5 h5 application root. | `sdkwork-image-h5/` |
| sdkwork-image-pc | pc | yes | sdkwork-image-pc pc application root. | `sdkwork-image-pc/` |

## Allowed Content

- Selected language/architecture application roots with `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.sdkwork/`, and `specs/` when authored packages exist.
- Architecture-local `packages/`, `config/`, `src/`, `lib/`, `App/`, or `entry/` directories required by the owning architecture standard.

## Forbidden Content
